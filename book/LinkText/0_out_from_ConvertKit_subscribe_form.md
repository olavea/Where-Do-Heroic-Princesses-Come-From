The Assassin, the future Queen, and her POW! Ladies
Can Lillian (13) stop the assassination of the Queen AND keep out of prison, together with PellÃ¦, her heroine?

Because Ola will write this story as a hobby, we agreed he could write it like a historical fiction novel. A novel that inspires you to take tiny steps into our world of healthier technologies. Not to worry non-devs and devs will not be mixed together. Non-devs will get THEIR tiny tasks and devs will get tiny tasks of their own.

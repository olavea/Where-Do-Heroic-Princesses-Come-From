Lilly and Ruby the Reckless
On the verge of a risky rescue of her fav sister's life, Ruby the Reckless Inventoress gets a blind passenger on the first test run of her time machine (the escape veichle).

Ruby gets trapped in Oslo some 465ish years into the future (present day) when the blind passenger steals the heart of her time machine and disappears.

To get back in time and save her sister's life, Ruby's only choice is to rebuild her time machine with pieces of wonky web technology. To learn how she takes a webdev job with a React Learning Curve From Hell.

Rude Ruby rumbles rudely/Recklessly around in the upside down start up world mentored by her co-intern the playful programmer and pre-schooler Lilly (6 ðŸ¦„).

BUT when the launch party is 13 days away the CEO, Benedicte, starts smilingly rebuilding The POW! Product with a shiny, new and better back end.

Ruby must learn to program playfuller together with Lilly (6 ðŸ¦„) to help finish The POW! Product AND re-build the time machine in time to save her sister's life by outsmarting their hateful half sister Mary the First.

The clock is ticking like a bomb back in the 1550s. Because
the now murderously majestic Mary is being manipulated by her mysterious and malevolent spy master who only wants his ROI:

Revenge
On
Idiots:

A long list of personal enemies he wants to see dead. Including Ruby's sister Lizabeth.

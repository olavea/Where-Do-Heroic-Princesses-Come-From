My most meaningful side project, and yours?


My most meaningful side project



Hi ,

Long time no see 😺

So what is the most meaningful side project you are doing / planning on doing these days?

All three in my tiny family are working together on POW! A period tracker that is easier to use for ladies who value privacy over piracy ☠️ 💀.

Just kidding about the piracy part 😸.

USA launch will be livestreaming tuesday March 10th at 10:30 NYC time. AND my CEO decided to implement a brand-new back end 19 days before launch 😅.


Because the end to end encryption will be playfuller to program for us. So that is good for me.

How does this new end to end encryption work you ask? Or
elk to elk encryption as I call it.

If you don't want to know, answer this email with "No" or "Nei" or "Ei helvetissä, miten?!"

In that case I will not send you an email with the Encrypted Elk story I told Lillian (5 🦄) to explain elk to elk encryption.

I will send the Encrypted Elk story out on Friday. It has a tower a princess and piratical pirates in it. Just saying...

All the best from the powdery, snowy, nippy North of Europe.

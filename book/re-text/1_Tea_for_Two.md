Tea for Two


"Wouldn't tea be tasty? Hm!?" Said Ruby. "My mild tea and my crunchy, chocolate buiscuits on my sunlit porch. Away from this... HORRIBLE house arrest."

Princess Elizabeth just wanted to hug her, she tried also, but Ruby just pushed her away.
"Elizabeth, nay, rein in thy horses! Are you coming, or not?" Said Ruby.

"Yess! Yes, but what about my baby sister? She will be locked up by my half sister now when there are nobody to stand up to her bully, big sister ways. I must send a warning to my baby sister to hide from the secret police before they lock her up the sweet, little thing." Said Elizabeth.

"Ok, I know who you need now, you need the world's most inventive inventoress." Said Ruby.

"Which inventoress is that?" Elizabeth asked with a tiny, sly smile. Ruby put hands on hips and stared back.

"A brave and beautiful and fashionably voluptuous inventoress at the prime of her inventing powers." Ruby said and pushed a pink, glittery, big button on her belly. On Ruby's back the rotors rotated going "rrr-RRR-ROOOOAR!" Ruby's short, muscular arms wrapped Elizabeth's waist, the pair floated gracefully up a meter. Then sailed out the open window, up over the castle roof, around a triple chimney and landed softly on a tiny pink porch.


The tiny pink porch was filled with flowers, a tiny table and two pink rocking chairs. Ruby glided into her little pink house and Elizabeth sat with a sigh. Elizabeth soaked in the sunshine and the colorful view of London rooftops all the way to the glittering river.

"If people only knew how lovely my city looks from this rooftop porch they..."

"I had the kettle on because I knew you would come, but first let's get that message off to your sweet sister." Ruby said and put down a pink tray with white and brown buiscuits and tea things. "Here is a question, how do we make sure only your SWEET, little sister gets your message and not your tyrannical, BIG sister?"

"I am sure you have a..."

"The World's Best crypto-algo-connector guess who that is?" Ruby pulled her stocky shoulders back and shot her chest forward.

"I daresay it COULD be you, but surely you didn't have time to..."

"Here!" Ruby gave Elizabeth a small silvery box with one red button. The box fit nicely in Elizabeth's hand.

"Say your name and password, then push the red button and talk in your message, it will get encrypted. I shall call it... The Talkman!"

Elizabeth held the Talkman to her lips.

"Elizabeth, just Elizabeth..."

"Good, good." Ruby interrupted. "Now, push the red button and talk your message into the Talkman." Ruby gave a flourish with her knobly, little hand. Elizabeth spoke her messaged and started eating the crunchy chocolate part of the buisicuit and then scrape the soft white cream off with her teeth, "sooo soft."


While Ruby attached the Talkman to the left claw of a magnificent, pink parrot with a glossy, black tophat. Ruby used a roll of some sticky, silvery, thing and a lot of inventive swear words. Cursing the sticky roll and cursing the pink parrot until the bird glided gracefully towards the river. Elizabeth and Ruby landed in Elizabeth's room in time to hear a knock at the door and "Please unlock, we know you are in there." In a polite, cultured and firm voice.

"So I am off to the Tower then James?" Said Elizabeth.

"Yes my Lady, but don't worry we will keep you safe." the polite, cultured and firm voice answered from outside the door.

"I will just put on something decent first, you will just wait a bit, will you not James?"

"Off course my Lady, the boys and me we will wait." the polite, cultured and firm voice answered from outside the door.

"Let's go and hide you somewhere." whispered Ruby.

"I will NOT run from my sister. I am the only one who dares stand up to her." Whispered Elizabeth.

"I will find somebody who can get you out of the Tower." Whispered Ruby.

"Yes, I trust you to find the right person for the job. Somebody without political or family ties here in London. So that means for example NOT you. Your hands must be 100% clean. A person with political or family ties here in London will make the rescue look like treason against my sister the Queen. But an independent actor with No Agenda is harder to make a treason case against." Whispered Elizabeth.

"I know just the young lady to get the job done." Whispered Ruby.

"Great. Tell me no names. Thank you. Good luck and goodbye." Elizabeth whispered and bent down and kissed Ruby on her brow.

"rrr-RRR" Ruby flew out the window and Elizabeth opened the door to a row of soldiers in shining armour.

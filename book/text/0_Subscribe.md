Because Ola will write this story as a hobby, we agreed he wculd write it like a historical fiction novel that inspires you to take tiny steps backstage into our world of healthier technologies. Not to worry non-devs and devs will not be mixed together. Non-devs will get THEIR tiny tasks and devs will get tiny tasks of their own.

Benedicte learns best when she codes first and shares that learning after. But knowing WHO she will share the learning with while she codes makes it more fun.

That is why having you subscribe as audience NOW will make Benedicte's learning that much more fun.

POW! Email Novel
Can Benedicte build a GOOD privacy first menstrual cycle tracker app? And have fun? Not without us (you to), so follow along on our learning journey through time and tech.

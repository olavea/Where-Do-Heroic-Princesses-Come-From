Where Do Heroic Girls Come From? Part 1

A red haired girl and a blonde girl, are bathing in the stream. Their elders would not approve, but the redhead don't care, she is not quite twelve years old, the blonde girl is nine years.

They were walking in the forest and came across a stream. The sun shone fiercely. In a hollow, the water widened into a pool the size of a car. It attracted them.

At first they just dipped their feet into it. Then they went in up to their knees. Lillian's little trousers got wet, so she threw them off. Then she pulled off her shirt as well. And all of a sudden both of them were splashing about with nothing on. Laughing out loud.

A small grey horse stands head down munching the long grass by the stream.

The bigger girl's name is Pell칝, a few hours ago she slipped the little grey stallion out the stable backdoor without anyone seeing.

To be continued.

"It is
* The First Law" said Lillian asked her dad

What is The First Law?

Don't touch your neighbour's secret.

Why?

Like Pell칝 said
"If you don't KNOW it's easier for you NOT to slip up and tell the wrong someone."

What does that mean?
How do you do that?
Build your thing

Privacy be design
Don't touch the secret of your neighbour

And they might well bathe. Nobody could see them there. The London road was a long way off and the forest was endless. If anyone were to catch sight of them, there would be trouble. Never mind the blond girl, she was just a guest, but the red haired Pell칝 was supposed to be a boy. Everybody knew her as "that silent stableboy" at the castle.

Why? You ask? Pell칝 wouldn't tell you. She would say, "If you don't KNOW it's easier for you NOT to slip up and tell the wrong someone." *

Who is the wrong someone then? Even Pell칝 didn't know THAT,

P.S
Why wouldn't she tell her secret?

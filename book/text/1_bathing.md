Part 1
Where Do Heroic Women Come From?

Two girls, a redhead and a blonde, are bathing in the stream. Maybe their elders would think it a bad idea, but the red haired girl don't care, she is not quite twelve years old, the blonde girl three years younger.

They were walking in the forest and came across a stream. The sun shone fiercely. In a hollow, the water widened into a pool the size of a car. It attracted them.

At first they just dipped their feet into it. Then they went in up to their knees. Pellæ's leather trousers got wet, so she threw them off. Then she pulled off her shirt as well. And all of a sudden both of them were splashing about with nothing on.

And they might well bathe. Nobody could see them there. The London road was a long way off and the forest was endless. If anyone were to catch sight of them, there would be trouble. Never mind the blond girl, she was just a guest, but the red haired Pellæ was supposed to be a boy. Everybody knew her as "that silent stableboy" at the castle.

Why? You ask? Pellæ wouldn't tell you. She would say, "If you don't KNOW it's easier for you NOT to slip up and tell the wrong someone." *

Who is the wrong someone then? Even Pellæ didn't know THAT, she didn't care and she was frankly fed up with being bored on a beautiful spring day. So she slipped the little grey stallion out the stable backdoor without anyone seeing.

To be continued.

P.S
Why wouldn't she tell her secret?


"It is
* The First Law" said Lillian asked her dad

What is The First Law?

Don't touch your neighbour's secret.

Why?

Like Pellæ said
"If you don't KNOW it's easier for you NOT to slip up and tell the wrong someone."

What does that mean?
How do you do that?
Build your thing

Privacy be design
Don't touch the secret of your neighbour

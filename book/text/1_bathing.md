Where Do Heroic Girls Come From?
Page 00

A red haired girl and a blonde girl, are bathing in the stream. Their elders would not approve, but the redhead don't care, she is not quite fifteen years old, the blonde girl is thirteen years.

They were walking in the forest and came across a stream. The sun shone fiercely. In a hollow, the water widened into a pool the size of a car. It attracted them.

At first they just dipped their feet into it. Then they went in up to their knees. Lillian's little trousers got wet, so she threw them off. Then she pulled off her shirt as well. And all of a sudden both of them were splashing about with nothing on. Laughing out loud.

A small grey pony stands head down munching the long grass by the stream.

The bigger girl's name is Pell칝, a few hours ago she slipped the little grey pony out the stable backdoor without anyone seeing.

"It is
* The First Law" said Lillian asked her dad

What is The First Law?

Don't touch your neighbour's secret.

Why?

Like Pell칝 said
"If you don't KNOW it's easier for you NOT to slip up and tell the wrong someone."

What does that mean?
How do you do that?
Build your thing

Privacy be design
Don't touch the secret of your neighbour

 she got bored she slipped the little grey pony out the stable backdoor without anyone seeing.

The "without anyone seeing" part was no accident. A dramatic distraction in the kitchens had everybody running towards the black smoke. Pell√¶ heard distressed voices getting distant as she looked over her shoulder at the castle kitchens disappearing behind a bend in the road. Soon, birdsong was all she could hear. Birdsong and "Clippety-clop."

"Just practicing my stagecraft," she whispered in the ear of the grey pony. "It's nothing personal against the kitchen staff you know. A girls gotta practice her REAL craft every day. How else can she tell who she REALLY is? Hm, Grey?" Pell√¶ gave the grey pony a green apple and stroked his neck feeling the muscles move. "Crunch. Munch. Munch." The Grey answered happily.

Up ahead in the golden fields she could see the little white library tower, with it's tiny red shed. Behind the tower, the winding road. Then the wide green forest and adventure.

P.S.
Lillian's father looks up at Lillian from reading. She has been listening to him reading out loud and now she can tell he will ask one of his questions.

"Pell√¶ says, "A girls gotta practice her REAL craft," which of the Laws does that remind you of?" He looks at Lillian with that Look.

"It reminds me of The Third Law." Lillian answers with confidence.

"Good. What then is The Third Law?" Asks her dad.

"Know Your Tools." Lillian Says.

"Right. Name one of your tools?" Asks her dad.

"Stripe API." Says Lillian.

"Can you show me an example of how you have practiced with Stripe API?" Asked her dad.

"Yes dad, look here on GitHub." Says Lillian.

"...might happen to YOU if YOU don't know your tools?" Asked her dad.

"If I don't know my tools PROPERLY it's easy for me to slip up while making a web app and let the wrong someone know my neighbours secret."

"Good. Good. Run and play now." Said her dad.

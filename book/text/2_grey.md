Welcome back to The Sunday POW!

Todays guest is Lillian Raae-Vea (5 ðŸ¦„). She'll introduce today's tiny tasks with a story:

"Go set up a button for payment on the POW! page." Mom told dad and me. "Use Stripe." She said.

So dad showed me how to use the window.Stripe(stripeKey) to "unlock" Stripe with mom's stripeKey. Then dad said "I'll start the developer server and you can click the donate button. As a test."

Did it work? No! We got this ugly error message instead:

Error this.Stripe is undefined
Error this.Stripe is undefined
Error this.Stripe is undefined
Error this.Stripe is undefined

In big, blood red letters on black. I cannot read, but I didn't NEED to read I felt it in my gut "BAD!"

"Goooood!" Dad said. "Now we can bugfix together. We'll follow these six steps: RAD CAT.
Read and
Ask.
Docz and
Compare.
Again and
Try."

1. Read
Read out loud to find the line in the error that tells you what happened.

"What line is that?" Ola asks.

"Error this.Stripe is undefined ..." Lillian answers.

"Yes." Ola says.

2. Ask
Ask yourself 'Can I find the Fix inside the error message?'

"Can you?" Ola asks.

"No..." Lillian answers

"Right!"

3. Docz

"Now let's find docz for doing what we are doing." Ola says.

"What are docz?" Lillian asks.

"Docz are like Baker Master Bunny's gingerbread baking song, do you remember it?" Ola asks.

"Yes. NÃ¥r eeeeen pepperkaker baker baker pepperkaker kaker tar han fÃ¸rst en ..."

"Good, good" Ola says.

4. Compare

Compare use case.

"Are we trying to do the exact same gatsby + stripe thing they describe here in these docz?" Ola asks.

"Ã˜h..." Lillian answers.

"Yes, yes we are. It is like in the Claus Climbermouse and the other animals in the Huckybucky forest book. We are like the baker's apprentice baking gingerbread, but ..."

"He did it wrong." Lillian says.

"Right. So what does the baker's apprentice have to do in the Claus Climbermouse and the other animals in the Huckybucky forest book?" Ola asks.

"Go and mind the store, while the Baker Master Bunny is baking the gingerbread cookies." Lillian answers.

"Eh, well ... Yes..."

"Bake again, but this time bake like in the song!" Lillian shouts.

"Yess!" Ola says.

5. Again
So we just do it again, but this time we do it exactly as the docz say. And you write what we do in your little red logbook. (Or pretend that you did it and write it down anyway, dear reader.)

"Here is your logbook Lillian, write:
'Terminal ðŸ’€' here in the top left corner. Draw a tiny skull. Then under that
'gatsby-plugin-stripe' and then under that
'gatsby develop' and then under that
'Terminal ðŸ’€, over and out' and then under that

'Go look in gatsby-config.js on GitHub and find gatsby-plugin-stripe in the plugins array.' There it is good." Ola says.

"Can I push the button now?" Lillian asks.

"Yes, soon. But what do we do if the bug doesn't go away and we get the same error message again?" Ola asks.

"Try and try?" Lillian says.

6. Try
"Try from the top: RAD CAT, but now you can push the pay button." Ola says.

"It works ðŸ˜…!" Lillian says.

 Ola asks.
 Ola says.
  Lillian says.
    Lillian asks.
 Lillian answers.

The Queen, the Assassin and Two Teenage Girls
Part 2
Where Do Heroic Girls Come From?

The older girls name is PellÃ¦. She had finished all her days tasks in the stable. So before

SAVES the Pony from ...
being ridden by that clumsy lordling, the lords rude son,
being sold? to that bortskjemt boy
veterinÃ¦rian
bored



 she got bored she slipped the little grey pony out the stable backdoor without anyone seeing.

The "without anyone seeing" part was no accident. A dramatic distraction in the kitchens had everybody running towards the black smoke. PellÃ¦ heard distressed voices getting distant as she looked over her shoulder at the castle kitchens disappearing behind a bend in the road. Soon, birdsong was all she could hear. Birdsong and "Clippety-clop."

"Just practicing my stagecraft," she whispered in the ear of the grey pony. "It's nothing personal against the kitchen staff you know. A girls gotta practice her REAL craft every day. How else can she tell who she REALLY is? Hm, Grey?" PellÃ¦ gave the grey pony a green apple and stroked his neck feeling the muscles move. "Crunch. Munch. Munch." The Grey answered happily.

Up ahead in the golden fields she could see the little white library tower, with it's tiny red shed. Behind the tower, the winding road. Then the wide green forest and adventure.

To be continued.




Enjoy your day and suddenly you'll get another tiny tale from Lilly Labs, written by Ola Vea


P.S.
Lillian's father looks up at Lillian from reading. She has been listening to him reading out loud and now she can tell he will ask one of his questions.

"PellÃ¦ says, "A girls gotta practice her REAL craft," which of the Laws does that remind you of?" He looks at Lillian with that Look.

"It reminds me of The Third Law." Lillian answers with confidence.

"Good. What then is The Third Law?" Asks her dad.

"Know Your Tools." Lillian Says.

"Right. Name one of your tools?" Asks her dad.

"Stripe API." Says Lillian.

"Can you show me an example of how you have practiced with Stripe API?" Asked her dad.

"Yes dad, look here on GitHub." Says Lillian.

"...might happen to YOU if YOU don't know your tools?" Asked her dad.

"If I don't know my tools PROPERLY it's easy for me to slip up while making a web app and let the wrong someone know my neighbours secret."

"Good. Good. Run and play now." Said her dad.

So she slipped the little grey stallion out the stable backdoor without anyone seeing.

No wonder no one saw them go. A dramatic distraction in the kitchens had covered their escape. She heard several distressed voices as she saw the castle kitchens disappear behind a bend in the road. Soon, birdsong was all she could hear. And "Clippety-clop."

"Just practicing my stagecraft," she stroked the grey horse. "Is nothing personal against the kitchen staff. A girls gotta practice her REAL craft every day. How else will she know who she REALLY is? I know you agree. Hm, Grey?" Pellæ gave the grey a green apple and stroked his neck feeling the muscles move. "Crunch. Munch. Munch."

Up ahead she could see the little library, with it's little red door. Behind the little library, the winding road, then the wide forest and freedom. At least for a few hours.

P.S.
Lillian's father looks up at her from his reading. She has been listening to him read out loud and she can tell he will ask one of his questions.

"Pellæ says, "A girls gotta practice her REAL craft every day," which of the Laws does that remind you of?" He looked at Lillian.

"It reminds me of The Third Law." Lillian answered with confidence.

"Good. What then is The Third Law?" Asked her dad.

"Know Your Tools." Said Lillian.

"Right. So what might happen to YOU if YOU don't know your tools?" Asked her dad.

"If I don't know my tools PROPERLY it's easy for me to slip up while making a web app and let the wrong someone know my neighbours secret."

"Good. Good. Run and play now." Said her dad.

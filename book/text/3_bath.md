Part 3
Where Do Heroic Girls Come From?

Up ahead she could see the white little library tower, with it's big red door and with it's tiny red shed. Behind the little library, the winding road. Then the wide forest and freedom, at least for a few hours.

As she passed the library, a girl peeped out the little red door.

"Boy! Boy!" the girl shouted, ran up to her in a shiny pink dress and grabbed her boot.

 "My name is Lillian. Please let me come to! I am bored." The girl said .

Pell칝 hadn't played with a girl for years so she told the well mannered girl, "yes". Got off the horse, helped Lillian up and said,
"I'll take you wherever you want to go."

"I want to go where the butterflies go." Said Lillian. The butterflies flitted into the forest. So they rode in that direction.

The Third Law, Book 1 The Mask Itself, Part 1 Where Do Heroic Women Come From?



Without her clothes Pell칝 is obviously a young lady of quality and hard training. She is as muscular as a ___ and as graceful as a __. As she splashed around in the water her red hair sticks out in spikes around her head. A small broad dagger in a leather sheath hanging in a leather tong around her neck.

Pellæ gave the grey a green apple and stroked his neck feeling the muscles move. Munch, Munch, Munch.

Without her clothes she is obviously a young lady of quality and hard training. She is as muscular as a ___ and as graceful as a __. As she splashed around in the water her red hair sticks out in spikes around her head.

"Lilly," she says to the smaller girl, "let's swim."

"Let's swim," croaks a big pink parrot sitting by Lilly's clothes, "let's swim, let's swim."


The ___ blonde-haired girl she calls Lilly turns round in the sparkling water. Pellæ strikes out for the bank. While the blonde girl floats on her back and kicks hard on the surface of the water.

But when they reach the bank, Pellæ grasps the green clump of bulrushes and looks around anxiously.

"Oh, what's happened to my little grey stallion?"


"Little grey," croaks the pink parrot, "little grey, little grey."

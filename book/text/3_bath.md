Where Do Heroic Girls Come From?

Up ahead she could see the white little library tower, with it's big red door and with it's tiny red shed. Behind the little library, the winding road. Then the wide forest and freedom, at least for a few hours.

As she passed the library, a girl peeped out the little red door.

"Boy! Boy!" the girl shouted, ran up to her in a shiny pink dress and grabbed her boot.

 "My name is Lillian. Please let me come to! I am bored." The girl said .

Pellæ hadn't played with a girl for years so she told the well mannered girl, "yes". Got off the horse, helped Lillian up and said,
"I'll take you wherever you want to go."

"I want to go where the butterflies go." Said Lillian. The butterflies flitted into the forest. So they rode in that direction.

Behind the tiny white tower, the winding road. Then the wide green forest and adventure. Adventure for a few hours.


"Lilly," she says to the smaller girl, "let's swim."

The ___ blonde-haired girl she calls Lilly turns round in the sparkling water. Pellæ strikes out for the bank. While the blonde girl floats on her back and kicks hard on the surface of the water.

And they might well swim. Nobody could see them there. The London road was a long way off and the forest was endless. If anyone were to catch sight of them, there would be trouble. Never mind the blond girl, she was just a guest, but the red haired girl, Pellæ, was supposed to be a boy. Everybody in the village knew her as "that silent stableboy" at the little castle.

Why is she hiding as a boy, you ask? If Lilly had asked, Pellæ wouldn't have told her. She would say, "If you don't KNOW it's easier for you not to slip up and tell someone."

The truth was that Pellæ didn't know who she was hiding from or why. Something about her father's enemies or something.

As she splashed around in the water her red hair sticks out in spikes around her head. A small broad dagger in a leather sheath hanging in a leather tong around her neck.

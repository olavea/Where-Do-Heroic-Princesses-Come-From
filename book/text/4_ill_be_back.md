"Oh, what's happened to my little grey stallion?"

She steps out of the water and runs here and there, peering among the trees. She examines the ground to for hoofprints.

"Wait for me, Lilly," she shouts to the girl, "Wait for me, I'll be back soon!" And naked as she is, she dashes off. Following the hooftracks towards the London road.

A few minutes later she comes back on the little grey stallion. She holds the thin rope that had been tied to its feet, it is bitten clean through.

The red haired girls silently strikes the horse with a bough of cornelia cherry. Her face is pale with terror, she keeps glancing over her shoulder. When she arrives at the place where they have been bathing, she hangs on to the horse's neck, then slides down and jumps to the ground.

"Hide!" She whispers shivering. "Hide! There's an Inquisitor coming."

With a couple of tugs she tethers the grey horse to a tree. She snatches her clothes from the ground and the two girls run naked to a __ bush. They hide. Crouching on the dead leaves behind the __ bush.

"I am a boy," Pellæ hisses

"WHAT?!" Lillian is gaping.

"If that black hearted Inquisitor catches us. I. Am. A. Boy. OK?" Pellæ is hissing too close to Lillian's ear. It hurts, almost.

"OK, you are a boy." Lillian shakes her head.

In those times black hearted Inquisitors and their black masked Practicals were a common sight on the roads. And you reader, who think that those two girls were bathing this spring in the stream are much mistaken. Where is that Inquisitor now? And where are the black masked Practicals and all those people you will meet in this email book, talking, tinkering, acting, laughing, crying, lying? They are all dust or ashes.

So put aside this years calendar reader, and in your mind bring out the calendar for 1569. You are now living in May of that year, and you are under the rule of Queen Elizabeth 1. Elizabeth's left hand man, Sir Francis Walsingham and his sneaky secret police or the Inquisition as we will call them.

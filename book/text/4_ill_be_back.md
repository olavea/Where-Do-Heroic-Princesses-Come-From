Where Do Heroic Girls Come From? Part¬†4

"Lillian," Pell√¶ says to the smaller girl, "let's swim."

The blonde-haired girl she calls Lillian turns round in the sparkling water. Pell√¶ strikes out for the bank. While the blonde girl floats on her back and kicks hard splashing sparkling drops high up.

And they might well swim. Nobody could see them there. The London road was a long way off and the forest was endless. But if anyone WERE to catch sight of them, there would be trouble. Never mind the blond girl, but the red haired girl, Pell√¶, was supposed to be a boy. Everybody in the village knew Pell√¶ as "that silent stableboy" living up in the cozy castle.

But Lillian came from far away and didn't see things the way the villagers saw things, so she asked,
"why are you dressed up as a boy Pell√¶?"

Pell√¶ looked annoyed and said,
"If you don't KNOW why it's easier for you to NOT tell the wrong someone."

"Yeah, I know. Ok then." Lillian said with a disappointed voice.

"Sorry. I don't really know why. It is something about hiding from my father's enemies or something.

"Oh! Ok..." Lillian said with knitted eyebrows.

"But. I know WHO to hide from, the black masked inquisitors. If inquisitors show up, I am to run off to London and hide there. In London, one more boy is just one more boy among a thousand boys in the streets. So my uncle James told me. He said, get to London, send me a note and blend in while you wait a few days for me to find a way to help hide you. So that is my plan."

"Wow! What a great plan! Let's go to London and blend in right now!" Lillian smiled with her whole face.

"Easy now. I am not running off to London if I don't need to hide." said Pell√¶ shaking her head slowly.

But when the two girls reach the bank, Pell√¶ grasps the green clump of bulrushes and looks around anxiously.

"Oh, what's happened to my little grey pony?"

P.S.
"I know what you are going to ask dad. The answer is The First Law." said Lillian.

"Where in the text are you reminded of The First Law?" Her dad asked.

"When Pell√¶ told Lillian, 'If you don't KNOW it's easier for you to NOT tell the wrong someone.' Is the place that reminds me of The First Law." Said Lillian.

"Yes and what is The First Law?" Her dad asked.

"Privacy by Design, it's how mom is building her POW! app. Let's say I write this note in my POW!

'Feeling #üëçtoday.'

Now if mom tries to read my note, she will see

'8rY7...blaBlaBla!'

Because of, you know,... crypto." Lillian said.

"Good" Her dad said.







 said Lillian.

"Oh, what's happened to my little grey stallion?"

She steps out of the water and runs here and there, peering among the trees. She examines the ground to for hoofprints.

"Wait for me, Lilly," she shouts to the girl, "Wait for me, I'll be back soon!" And naked as she is, she dashes off. Following the hooftracks towards the London road.

A few minutes later she comes back on the little grey stallion. She holds the thin rope that had been tied to its feet, it is bitten clean through.

The red haired girls silently strikes the horse with a bough of cornelia cherry. Her face is pale with terror, she keeps glancing over her shoulder. When she arrives at the place where they have been bathing, she hangs on to the horse's neck, then slides down and jumps to the ground.

"Hide!" She whispers shivering. "Hide! There's an Inquisitor coming."

With a couple of tugs she tethers the grey horse to a tree. She snatches her clothes from the ground and the two girls run naked to a __ bush. They hide. Crouching on the dead leaves behind the __ bush.

"I am a boy," Pell√¶ hisses

"WHAT?!" Lillian is gaping.

"If that black hearted Inquisitor catches us. I. Am. A. Boy. OK?" Pell√¶ is hissing too close to Lillian's ear. It hurts, almost.

"OK, you are a boy." Lillian shakes her head.

In those times black hearted Inquisitors and their black masked Practicals were a common sight on the roads. And you reader, who think that those two girls were bathing this spring in the stream are much mistaken. Where is that Inquisitor now? And where are the black masked Practicals and all those people you will meet in this email book, talking, tinkering, acting, laughing, crying, lying? They are all dust or ashes.

So put aside this years calendar reader, and in your mind bring out the calendar for 1569. You are now living in May of that year, and you are under the rule of Queen Elizabeth 1. Elizabeth's left hand man, Sir Francis Walsingham and his sneaky secret police or the Inquisition as we will call them.

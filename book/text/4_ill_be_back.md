# The Queen, the Assassin and The Teenage Girls
## Part¬†4
## Where Do Heroic Girls Come From?

"Lillian," Pell√¶ says to the smaller girl, "let's swim."

The blonde-haired girl she calls Lillian turns round in the sparkling water. Pell√¶ strikes out for the bank. While the blonde girl floats on her back and kicks hard splashing high up.

And they might well swim. Nobody could see them there. The London road was a long way off and the forest was wild. But if anyone WERE to catch sight of them, there would be trouble. Never mind the blond girl, but the red haired girl, Pell√¶, was supposed to be a boy. Everybody in the village knew Pell√¶ as "that silent stableboy" living up in the cozy castle.

But Lillian came from far away, so she asked,
"why are you dressed up as a boy Pell√¶?"

Pell√¶ looked annoyed and said,
"It is better for you if you don't KNOW why because then it's easier for you to NOT tell the wrong someone."

"Yeah, well. Ok then." Lillian said with a disappointed voice.

"Sorry. I don't actually know why and my uncle gave that exact reason." Pell√¶ said with knitted eyebrows.

"Oh! Ok..." Lillian said smiling.

"I may not know why, but I can tell you WHO I am hiding from dressed up as a boy. The black masked inquisitors. If inquisitors show up, I am to run off to London and hide there. My uncle James said, get to London, send me a note and blend in while you wait a few days for me to help hide you. So that is my plan B."

Lillian smiled with her whole face and burst out:
"Wow! What a great plan! Let's go to London and we could maybe help the young Queen against her enemies. I bet the Queen has some exitingly dangerous enemies and ..."

"Eeeaasy now. I am NOT running off to London. Is there a wild forest in London? Hm?" said Pell√¶ shaking her head slowly.

"Nooo..., but what if we helped stop an assassin from killing the Queen and ...

"hush!"

The two girls reach the bank, Pell√¶ grasps the green clump of bulrushes and looks around anxiously.

"Oh, what's happened to my little grey pony?"

## Todays Tiny Tasks for Non-devs:
Take a look at how Benedicte makes sure nobody can read the card numbers of her donators to POW!

If the user clicks the payment button, she is redirected to a page where she may write her card number and it is all good because Stripe makes sure her card number is always unreadable.

Go to the [POW! code on GitHub by clicking this link](https://github.com/raae/pow-app/blob/master/src/components/AngelsCheckout.js)


When you are there

P.S.
"I know what you are going to ask dad. The answer is The First Law." said Lillian.

"Where in the text are you reminded of The First Law?" Her dad asked.

"When Pell√¶ told Lillian, 'If you don't KNOW it's easier for you to NOT tell the wrong someone.' Is the place that reminds me of The First Law." Said Lillian.

"Yes and what is The First Law?" Her dad asked.

"Privacy by Design, it's how mom is building her POW! app. Let's say I write this note in my POW!

'Feeling #üëçtoday.'

Now if mom tries to read my note, she will see

'8rY7...blaBlaBla!'

Because of, you know,... crypto something." Lillian said.

"Good" Her dad said.

"But. Didn't we do a crypto thing with Stripe?" Lillian said.

"Yeah, show me on github." Her dad said.

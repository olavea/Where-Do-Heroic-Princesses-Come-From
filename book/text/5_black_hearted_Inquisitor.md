Welcome to this email üò∫where I will start showing you how Benedicte builds POW!

If you chose to do all the tiny tasks you will end up building your own webapp, and while you are bulilding you will better understand Benedicte's building philosophy.

AND you will have fun building.

And in time you will learn to love some of the tools of our trade, other tools you will learn to hate üòú.

So open your heart for:

Today's Tiny Tasks
1. Go to this link on GitHub

2. Find where Benedicte has written "Lag en knapp, commit og push."

Explanation:
In developer english this translates as "Ola, make a button and show me your code here on GitHub."

3. Before you go looking at my code remember, you will build this button yourself in a few weeks.

4. Read my code from the top,
When you find the button, stop.

Here is thelink on GitHub

5. That's all the Tiny Tasks for today. And now, todays tiny tale:


Where Do Heroic Girls Come From?
Page 5

"Oh, what's happened to my little grey pony?"

Pell√¶ steps out of the water and examines the ground for hoofprints.

"Wait for me, Lillian," she shouts, "Wait for me, I'll be back soon!" And naked as she is, she dashes off. Following the hooftracks towards the London road.

A few minutes later she comes back with the little grey pony. She holds the thin rope that had been tied to its feet, it is bitten clean through.

The red haired girl silently strikes the horse with a bough of cornelian cherry dogwood. Her face is pale with terror, she keeps glancing over her shoulder.

"Hide!" Pell√¶ whispers shivering. "Hide! There's an Inquisitor coming."

With a couple of tugs she tethers the grey horse to a tree. She snatches her clothes from the ground and the two girls run naked to a juniper bush. They hide. Crouching on the dead leaves behind the juniper bush.

"I am a boy," Pell√¶ hisses

"WHAT?!" Lillian is gaping.

"If that black hearted Inquisitor catches us. I. Am. A. Boy. OK?" Pell√¶ is hissing too close to Lillian's ear. It hurts, almost.

To be continued.

"OK, you are a boy." Lillian shakes her head.

In those times black hearted Inquisitors and their black masked Practicals were a common sight on the roads. And you reader, who think that those two girls were bathing this spring in the stream are much mistaken. Where is that Inquisitor now? And where are all those people you will meet in this email book, talking, laughing, crying, lying? They are all dust or ashes.

So put aside this years calendar reader, and in your mind bring out the calendar for 1569. You are now living in May of that year, and you are under the rule of Queen Elizabeth 1. A rule made weak by the stong hands of enemies outside Britain and made weak by the cunning hands of enemies inside the walls of London.

Pell√¶ has day dreamed about dramatically saving the hansome young Queen from assasination attempts. Now Pell√¶ needs to save herself and her new friend from the chains of the Inquisition. The Inquisition is not the real name of the sneaky secret police force organized by Elizabeth's left hand man, Sir Francis Walsingham, it is just Pell√¶'s nick name for them.

Jump it.


The cozy castle Pell√¶ calles home, lies hidden deep in the green countryside. Hidden from courtly intrigues and hidden from big city bustle in faraway London. The old local lord, his lady wife, his staff, his farmers and his happy villagers all think, "the secret police will never find their way here! How could they?! The road is bad even when it is NOT raining. And steep."

There are no traitors here, because there are no reasons to betray Queen or Country. People live and die in their thatched houses in their little hidden village like woodland insects.

The stablemaster looked at his apprentice Pell√¶ and saw a quiet, hard working, fast learning boy. "Oy! Boy! Brush the Grey." The stablemaster said, not needing to add that the Grey pony hadn't seen a brush for days, Pell√¶ knew and probably would have brushed the Grey anyway. As Pell√¶ walked off with the good brush the stablemaster thought "I wish my other apprentices were more like you."

Pell√¶ had brushed down and later gone into the forest with the Grey. On the way, she passed the library, a girl and a proud, pink, parrot had peeped out the double doors.

"Boy! Boy!" the girl had shouted and "Boy! Boy!" the parrot croaked an spread its pink wings wide behind the girl in her pink dress.

"My name is Lillian Please let me come to! I am boooored!" The girl had said and the parrot croaked "Boooored! Boooored!"

Pell√¶ hadn't played with a girl for years and could not let this chance go. So she told the well dressed and well mannered girl, "yes". Got off the horse, helped Lillian up and said,

"I'll take you wherever you want to go."
"I want to go where the butterflies go." Said Lillian. The butterflies flitted into the forest. So they to rode in that direction.

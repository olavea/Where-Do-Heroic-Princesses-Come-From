William Cecil's left hand man Sir Francis Walsingham and his sneaky secret police or the Inquisition as I will call them.

The cozy castle Pellæ calles home, lies hidden deep in the green countryside. Hidden from courtly intrigues and hidden from big city bustle in faraway London. The old local lord, his lady wife, his staff, his farmers and his happy villagers all think, "the secret police will never find their way here! How could they?! The road is bad even when it is NOT raining. And steep."

There are no traitors here, because there are no reasons to betray Queen or Country. People live and die in their thatched houses in their little hidden village like woodland insects.

The stablemaster looked at his apprentice Petroclus and saw a quiet, hard working, fast learning boy. "Oy! Boy! Brush the Grey." The stablemaster said, not needing to add that the Grey stallion hadn't seen a brush for days, Petroclus knew and probably would have brushed the Grey anyway. As Petroclus walked off with the good brush the stablemaster thought "I wish my other apprentices were more like you."

Pellæ had brushed down and later gone into the forest with the Grey. On the way, she passed the library, a girl and a proud, pink, parrot had peeped out the double doors.

"Boy! Boy!" the girl had shouted and "Boy! Boy!" the parrot croaked an spread its pink wings wide behind the girl in her pink dress.

"My name is Lillian Please let me come to! I am boooored!" The girl had said and the parrot croaked "Boooored! Boooored!"

Pellæ hadn't played with a girl for years and could not let this chance go. So she told the well dressed and well mannered girl, "yes". Got off the horse, helped Lillian up and said,

"I'll take you wherever you want to go."
"I want to go where the butterflies go." Said Lillian. The butterflies flitted into the forest. So they to rode in that direction.

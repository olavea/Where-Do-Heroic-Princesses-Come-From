Lilly (13) sat alone in her room with unfocused eyes directed at the open window. The laptop in front of her forgotten.

"rrr-RRR" the rotor-like sound coming closer made Lilly smile.

"Heeellooooo!! Ruuuubyyy!! Lilly yelled out her window.

"Heeellooooo. Liillyyy." Ruby said floating down outside the window. "What ARE you building? No, don't bore me. Let's build something PlayFuller instead."

"NO Ruby! I will finish building this API thingy..."

"API?!" Ruby said. "The worlds PlayFullest AJAX builder guess who that is?" Ruby went "rrr-RRR" in the window.

"Ha-ha! It's you! So tell me ONE PlayFull thing you have built with a boring bank API." Said Lilly.

"Let's build a testable prototype for timetravel, and go back to my flower filled rooftop porch. We enjoy the view of pre-Shake-spear-ean London with some crunchy cookies and ..."

"NO! Cookies! Cookies! Always with the Cookies! Your plan is not exactly action packed you know. I'm seeing an adventure ... where ... A girl is kidnapped by the ... wily witches and a green, shiny, deadly dragon is guarding the large ladder up to the crying girls cruel cage ..."

"OK-OK" Ruby interrupted. "The worlds extremest adventure planner, guess who that is?!"

"You, but ..."

"How about we go rescue a regally, red-haired princess from a prison-like tower cell. Where she is un-lawfully locked up by her bully, big-sister Queen." Ruby said.

"Witch! Witch!" Lilly shouted.

"Witch-like Queen then. The witchy, bitchy Queen who has..."

"Placed the deadly dragon! Don't forget the green, shiny, deadly ... "

"There's no green, shiny, deadly, dragon, but there REALLY is a regally, red-haired princess. And we really ARE rescuing her, because she is my best friend." Ruby said.

Your best friend is ME, Lilly thought bitterly, but she said. "DEAL, even if there is no green, shiny, deadly, dragon. I will help rescue your regally, red-haired princess, but we must be quick. My father will tell me off if I am not back for dinner at 17:00." Said Lilly.

I promise to have you back by dinner. Now let me play around with your code." Ruby grabbed the laptop and flew out the window.

Lilly climbed after and saw Ruby beside the tiny, blue, backyard shed. The door was open, all the gardening tools were in a pile on the gravel.

"Where did that blue USB cable come from?" Lilly said.

"Oh this thing?!" Ruby put the blue USB cable into Lilly's laptop. The blue USB cable came from under the tiny, blue, backyard shed.

"Could you please hurry to remove every item from inside this shed? Or there will not be enough room for a ..."

"Sure, but what are you doing to my code?" Lilly said.

"I'll show you. Here. I used A different redirect component. Also from Stripe. And here I changed "url" to "irl" and I changed "www" to "ww"" Ruby pointed with her stubby forefinger.

"I see. "ww" "world wide" without the "web". You are not all that into web development are you? But don't we need to add a new Gatsy-plugin for time travel?" Lilly said.


"You hit it on the head! How could I forget to install my own plugin? The world's PlayFullest Gatsby-plugin builder guess who that is!?"

"You! Hi-hi!" Lilly said.

"London here we come!" Ruby said.

"Even if we get no error message that's not going to work because..." Lilly said.

------------------->

"Only one way to find out" Ruby's grabbed Lilly's lower arm and dragged her into the tiny shed. "Please close the door after ourself. That is the 'event' that starts our redirectToCheckout." Ruby said.

Lilly closed the door and waited in the semi darkness counting silently "1, 2, 3, ..." Nothing happened, of course.

"I am opening this door now." Lilly said and stepped into sunshine and a wall of flower fragnance on a flower filled rooftop porch.

"Wow! WHAT a vieeeeew! LOOK at that glittering river, it glitters like ... GLITTER!" Lilly shouted, turning in a tiny circle with her arms out.

"And THAT's why people call me Ruby 'AJAX' Rooftop. Where the 'X' stands for e-Xtreme and the last 'A' stands for Adventure." Ruby bowed elaboratley in the door of her tiny pink house.
